That said, an approach based on algorithmically detecting repeated segments of lengths consistent with ad spots would work just as well, if not better.<p>P.S. One thing I thought was really interesting was that the classifier -- that was only ever shown a binary label (ad&#x2F;not-an-ad) -- learnt an embedding that grouped together entire categories of things across TV networks and geographies (studio news, weather, traffic reports etc).",

In the US these are typically 15s, 30s and 60s (sometimes 45s).  This property could be exploited to detect ads.  Consider, for example, a video segment that&#x27;s exactly 30s in duration and is repeated many times over multiple TV channels.  It is very likely to be an ad.",

Granted some employees are ordered to use it as a greeting, but most people who ask genuinely care, and there is no social expectation to ask. Perhaps the culture in the USA is just a bit more personable than you have a theory of mind for?   If you really don’t believe me, try answering the question in the negative, theres a reason why its like a joke that you have to respond positively. You’ll instantly be asked whats bothering you, and most people won’t let go easily. They genuinely want to try to cheer you up if you aren’t doing well and if they think they can reasonably help you, generally will.",

Particularly while doing something like driving, because I&#x27;m juggling a lot of information in those situations and paying more attention to the people around me, rather than just focusing on signs.<p>For a long time I thought that was all just due to crowds&#x2F;stress and nothing else, but I&#x27;m increasingly convinced that part of it is just that it&#x27;s harder for me to pick out when scanning a room where the signs are the indicate where I&#x27;m supposed to be. Also seems to make it more likely that I&#x27;ll walk past an indicator or miss something while I&#x27;m trying to navigate the space. I&#x27;m always paranoid inside of these busier spaces about whether I&#x27;m going to miss something important and end up walking in the opposite direction of where I need to go.<p>It may depend a lot on not just the area but also what you&#x27;re personally used to; navigation in these spaces are a skill that people get better at over time. I suspect that some of the difficulties become less difficult as people&#x27;s brains get better at filtering things out or recognizing indicators that they need to zero in on. In the same way that after a while playing a game you start to instinctively zero in on certain UX choices or indicators in a level, people also instinctively start to zero in on how a city indicates important information (is the sign always green, does it tend to show up in a specific place). So this might also be more of an early-user UX problem for people who don&#x27;t go into the city all the time or who are particularly susceptible to getting distracted by motion&#x2F;colors.<p>----<p>There&#x27;s a lot of research that brains are really good at learning to filter out advertising; part of the arms race in advertising isn&#x27;t just with ad blockers, it&#x27;s figuring out how to present ads in increasingly unusual ways where your brain won&#x27;t just do pattern recognition and literally just refuse to process or register them. Human brains are heckin good at pattern recognition.<p>But that means that there is an arms race with advertisers trying to figure out what the next evolution is with billboards or how to trick your brain to register things, and it means that people who are less equipped to do that filtering or are just unfamiliar with the space often end up getting thrown in the deep end because their brains aren&#x27;t trained to do that filtering yet, or are trained to filter different things.",

But I guess it&#x27;s somewhat reasonable, maybe, to make the argument that male model ads are trying to say something like, &quot;this is the clothing that attractive men wear, and if you were attractive you&#x27;d buy this.&quot; Or even, &quot;this man is attractive and thus obviously has his life put together, and maybe you&#x27;d feel more like him if you had his brand of underwear on.&quot;<p>But I&#x27;m much more sympathetic to and supportive of extremely broad statements like, &quot;both sexy women ads and sexy men ads influence beauty standards in sometimes unhealthy&#x2F;unobtainable directions regardless of the intent&#x2F;purpose of the ad.&quot; I feel like getting super-specific about what exactly is running through a man&#x27;s mind when they see an ad for underwear is when we start to get uncomfortably close to pseudoscience. But the much broader statement feels a lot less like pseudoscience, it does seem fairly clear that beauty standards are influenced by advertising (and by other things too, advertising is just one aspect of this).",

Before you scream at me, let me take a step back: of course ad-tech is by far not as horribly bad as slavery. Still the practices they established in the last decades are a violation of human rights, in the european interpretation. They track and profile humans online to a level no private investigator could do offline. And we are at the beginning of what is possible: people place network active microphones and cameras in their homes or carry them around all day. Devices they no longer control, since &quot;no root for consumers&quot; became a security feature. Public spaces are increasingly surveilled by networked cameras, physical advertisements in public spaces and private businesses track wireless signals of nearby phones. Privatized mass surveillance became the norm in cyberspace and the same is happening in meatspace as well. And at the same time the algorithms that guess which content best manipulates individual people into buying, voting or believing something are getting better fast and are deployed at scale.<p>We are at a crossroads of how society will develop, and this mentality that corporations can collect and use personal data however they like (and they like to manipulate people) is no longer acceptable. And if these corporations weren&#x27;t creepy enough with their systematic stalking, governments lean more and more towards also using that data. As long as the government promises it is &quot;just for fighting crime&quot; people are somewhat consenting, but on the territory of my country we had two totalitarian regimes in the last century that abused data gathering at scale to identify and oppress their political opposition, to terrorize and murder them. Horrors like the STASI must never happen again. Say no to surveillance capitalism while you still can, demand a constitutional right to the protection of personal data now! Because the freedom of governments and corporations must be limited, so the freedom of the people is preserved.<p>The market must change, it is necessary. What we want is that you can take your smartphone and tell it that it is ok if it connects to the supermarkets augmented reality and every ad-space you walk by becomes a personalized experience, if that is your choice. That is your freedom. Don&#x27;t let the ad-provider of the supermarket make that choice for you. Don&#x27;t let someone tell you that freedom means you could choose to not go to the supermarket and instead grow potatos in your one room flat. That is bullshit.

The EU politicians had to have known that they didn&#x27;t work from previous experience, but decided to inflict us with these pop ups anyway. Their own damn website has this pop up.[0]<p>Reasons why cookie banners don&#x27;t work:<p>1. They need to be implemented by the website. This means that if a website decides to ignore the cookie law they can set all the cookies they want and you won&#x27;t be notified. If they are outside of the EU&#x27;s jurisdiction they won&#x27;t even care.<p>2. Targeted advertising is how a lot of websites pay the bills. This means that websites will use every trick in the book to get you to not click on the &quot;refuse&quot; button. Why wouldn&#x27;t they? You&#x27;re using their server time, but generating no revenue if you refuse. Websites will fight this process. They&#x27;ll eventually lose, but the internet will either turn into a splinternet or cable TV. Ads are what make free websites work and cookies is how it happens right now.<p>3. Websites are made by people who aren&#x27;t always well-versed in legalese and can&#x27;t just hire a lawyer for everything. They don&#x27;t always know whether they need a pop up or not. The safer option is to put it up there. If the EU&#x27;s own website has one then probably so does yours.<p>4. Popups are annoying.<p>Cookies should be handled by the browser.

          "content": "&gt; But ads in real life do not prevent me from going on about my day.<p>More common than you might expect, other people here have brought up checkout processes, etc... Beyond what they have said, I want to suggest though that some of the spacing and positioning and navigation around cities&#x2F;roads is limited by needing room for advertising. There&#x27;s a limit to how much information you can put along the side of a road in a city, and more of that space could be devoted to more obvious navigation signs at more regular intervals if advertising wasn&#x27;t taking up some of that space.<p>Maybe this is a stretch, but I wonder how much less stressful it would be if the biggest visual indicator on a bus stop was the actual bus stop number and not the full-page ad. In my mind, that is kind of delaying information until after you&#x27;ve passed through this space where you can only see the ad.<p>&gt; it would be infuriating if you had to view an ad before being able to use the subway ticketing system. You also don’t have ads on at the airport timetable screen.<p>Another example that springs to mind, I ride publicly funded transportation. The trains have displays inside of the train that indicate what the next stop will be. Those get interrupted by ads, if you glance up and want to see how close you are to your stop, you will likely need to sit through an ad before that information will pop up on the screen again. And that&#x27;s not even in a private establishment, this is ads showing up in public space that isn&#x27;t owned by any company. It&#x27;s not even a 1st Amendment thing, they don&#x27;t have any right to that space, we just decided to sell advertising space to those companies.<p>Forcing people to view ads before they enter a subway or check out at a store is definitely something companies are starting to pay attention to and would be willing to try. A few physical stores have even started to roll out non-transparent glass in frozen sections that have ads overtop, so you can&#x27;t walk through the isle and look to see what the store has, you have to open each section and manually check, and the glass screens just show you ads instead.<p>&gt; You don’t have pinkertons following you to learn your habits and show you “relevant” ads.<p>This is also kind of a fun rabbit hole to jump down, there is a surprising amount of real-world data that gets processed for advertising; stores have experimented with tracking customers as they go through isles using facial recognition and&#x2F;or tracking signals emitted from devices. Most loyalty cards feed purchases into a database so you can be tracked.<p>And companies have been for a while now experimenting with and kind of openly talking about doing eye tracking in billboard ads in cities. To the best of my knowledge this has not actually been rolled out anywhere, but it keeps on coming up in research papers&#x2F;patents&#x2F;etc... and I think it&#x27;s likely it will become common practice at some point.<p>There&#x27;s a connective tissue between digital advertising in physical spaces and digital spaces, and once you start to pick apart the links, it&#x27;s hard to stop seeing them. A lot of digital tracking is augmented by physical tracking, and a nontrivial amount of digital tracking&#x2F;profiles gets used in situations with real-world consequences.<p>Some of the systems I talk about above like in-store ads are really only waiting for ways to be personalized per-customer before they can linked back into the tracking systems, and for stuff like dynamic displays, ads pre-purchase, etc... there&#x27;s potential there to personalize them, which I think companies are likely to start taking advantage of.<p>----<p>&gt; But yes, unhealthy amount of advertising IRL should be limited as well.<p>All that being said, I do think you&#x27;re completely right, and I do think this is the slightly stronger argument: excessive advertising is just plain unhealthy period.<p>I get into the tracking&#x2F;disruption aspects of things because people respond to those aspects, but there&#x27;s a downside there which is that they suggest there&#x27;s a way to do pervasive advertising everywhere that would be fine if only they were more private or had skip buttons, and I honestly don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.<p>I dislike abusive ads a lot, but I also dislike <i>ads</i>, in general. I think it&#x27;s unhealthy for us to have this much mental energy devoted to basically fielding corporate propaganda all the time, I think this affects our ability to devote energy to responding to things like political propaganda or researching news articles and validating facts we see online, or being charitable to other disruptions or focusing in on the world around us.<p>That could be a much, much longer conversation, but I think you&#x27;re completely correct to kind of step back and say, &quot;does it really <i>matter</i> if the physical space is completely analogous to the online space?&quot; There are negative outcomes related to having so much of urban space devoted to trying to trick people into buying things. And I do think there are healthier ways to do that advertising, and I do think some advertising is worse than other advertising, and there is definitely a spectrum and a continuum here in how I respond to ads, but I also just think that excessive advertising is unhealthy regardless of the form it takes and I worry that when I talk about eye-tracking and loyalty cards that I might distract people from the more primitive and basic argument of &quot;it&#x27;s heckin ugly to have giant ads blocking your view of the actual products in a store, and it&#x27;s heckin ugly to have a bunch of billboards for Pepsi in the middle of a public park.&quot;",

      "content": "I cycle to work on an ebike. About 25 km each way. One of the major issues is the lack of proper infrastructure and awful attitude by drivers, in particular service drivers.<p>Advertisement company vans are a prime example. There are rolling advertisement posters  in most bus stop shelters. These drivers will park up on the footpath blocking pedestrians and those using the bus to update the advertisements, often in the mornings during rush hour. They will park on the cycle lanes and force cyclists out into fast moving and unaccommodating aggressive traffic.<p>The same goes for delivery drivers. Legally they are permitted on double yellow ‘no parking’ lines on the street but the perception is no not hinder car traffic so they park up on the footpath instead.<p>During the pandemic there was a lot of temporary work on cycling infrastructure, mostly lazy efforts such as painted cycle lanes and plastic bollards. These drivers simply drive over the bollards or if wide enough down the protected lane. If you challenge them they are verbally abusive.<p>The attitude of all persons in a mechanically propelled vehicle is that this is not their fault. They are just doing their job. Their companies trot out the tired line that they take safety seriously bla bla bla…<p>So in regards physical advertisement is public space, for me this is a symptom of a wider problem of perceptions of ownership of our cities public space. We forget that cities are for people. We let cars dominate the majority of the available space. We let oversized vehicles make deliveries in medieval city streets. We use cars for short inappropriately short journeys such as for bringing our kids to school, often because it’s too dangerous to let them walk or cycle because there are too many cars.<p>We need to start treating our cities like parks with a focus people and figure out ways to remove ICE powered vehicles and limit the space all vehicles occupy.",

They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you’re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.\n\n    You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.\n\n    Fuck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It’s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.\n\n    You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.\n\n    – Banksy</code></pre>",

That latter point is how I have justified to myself running an ad blocker.<p>Often I&#x27;ve equated online advertisements to physical ones, and also noted that what we consider &quot;ads&quot; online is fairly narrow and in a way that helps us justify vilifying them.  Advertising can be helpful, and not just in the &quot;I didn&#x27;t know about that product until I saw the ad&quot; way, but in the way that every store name above or on the door is an advertisement, and in it&#x27;s most minimal form, a purely useful informational one (the sign advertising restrooms is &quot;advertising&quot; that).  There is, necessarily, a spectrum along which advertisements run, from informational or coercive and manipulative, but it is a spectrum, and it is important to note what it is we object to, because &quot;advertisements&quot; is a poor substitute for what that is and unless we identify it, we&#x27;re doomed to inadequately deal with it.<p>The idea that very public advertisements in the real world is an interesting one, because we&#x27;re often presented with them even when using only public resources.  Going into a store and seeing advertisements is one thing, you chose to go there and they control that area, but to be confronted with something while on public thoroughfares is another thing entirely.  In some respect I totally agree, why should they be allowed to push these images and sounds towards me?<p>On the other hand, this makes me think of Home Owners Associations and people trying to control their environment (if we assume this is something to be prevented, and not just something we can assume is public domain to remix and use at will if presented in that public manner).  In any case, it&#x27;s an interesting additional context to the idea of advertising in physical and digital ways and how they relate and I&#x27;ll be thinking on it in the future, so I thank you for sharing it.",

I wouldn&#x27;t go 25km&#x2F;h in a pedestrian zone because sooner or later I would probably hit someone. When I am on a scooter I have to really think before I drive.<p>I don&#x27;t think cars and scooters compete for the same space. Pedestrians, bikes and scooters compete. The vast majority of people going on scooters do so instead of walking, biking or going on public transport.<p>If I could decide all city centres would be void of cars and people could bike and scooter on the old car roads to their hearts delight. Until then I would prefer scooters to be driven responisbly, either through regulation or common sense.<p>In my 34 years alive I have never been hit by a bike, yet in the last 3.4 months I have been hit by a acooter twice. Once in the back on a pedestrian street when the driver turned a corner and wasn&#x27;t expecting me to stand at a bus stop.

This is by itself interesting as public adverts can penetrate the most strict censorship that religious groups and cults maintain.<p>Seculars on the other hand can also be pissed about anti-abortion adverts, religious propaganda, scientology, etc. and ask for them to be banned.<p>As someone who&#x27;s trying to be a &quot;free-thinker&quot; and tries to promote it, I think there&#x27;s no point in hiding in a bubble, blocking yourself from seeing other ideas, even if they&#x27;re crappy advertisements.

Complete ban of all outdoor advertising except shopfronts and limit those.<p>Now, since you can&#x27;t just ban it outright, there&#x27;s still need for advertising, a different solution should be offered:<p>Every community needs to have a public billboard, setup and maintained by the local government, one per 500 residents, where 25% of the area is auctioned to commercial ads, 25% is awarded with a lottery system (to prevent money dominating too much), 25% for cultural events and 25% for nonprofits and charity. \nThe advertising space should be place in a crowded area (like a square). It needs some extra rules for high density area, so that space can be grouped, but not too much.<p>All other outdoor advertising is banned. Since a lot of companies would be effectively banned by this move, some sort of (small) compensation should be paid to them and time given, so they can pivot.\nCosts of removing the advertising should be subsidized for the same reason. Any advertising facades or roofs (i.e. different colored tiles used to make the roof) can stay, but the ad has to be removed when the roof&#x2F;facade is replaced.\nMoney coming in from the ad actions should more than cover this expense.<p>Possibly add an exception to &quot;shopping center&quot;, where such advertising is permitted, but with strict rules to what such a center is (i.e. has no residents).<p>I know most Americans will balk at such &quot;government overreach&quot; but I think it could pass here if someone actually put some effort in.",

It is so bright that you can&#x27;t make out what is in the road beyond it. Multiple people have complained about it my city&#x27;s subreddit and it has lead to at least one traffic accident that I know about. I even went to file a complaint with the city zoning board about that one but was told there was nothing they could do as there were no regulations regarding the brightness of signs. They suggested I complain to the owner.<p>And it&#x27;s so manipulative. &quot;Hey, you&#x27;re not good enough because you&#x27;re too fat, or your hair is thinning, and no one will ever love you.&quot; &quot;Look at these starving abused puppies, just LOOK AT THEM and donate now.&quot;<p>In the ever increasing war for our attention, it really does feel like physical advertising is becoming louder, more aggressive, more insulting, and just so much more ubiquitous that it is almost impossible to get away from it.

      "content": "I don&#x27;t know, this doesn&#x27;t sound like an actionable advice to me. Which is pretty much why I take advertising as a given. And, yes, I don&#x27;t think one should defend it. I mean, just watch some anti-utopia sci-fi, where everyone has to watch ads about everywhere, then compare it with the direction we are heading to, and reassess your position on &quot;ads being ok&quot;.<p>But I just don&#x27;t see an alternative, and I don&#x27;t imagine how one can draw a line between what&#x27;s good and what isn&#x27;t. In a sense, there cannot be good ads by definition. In a perfect world, there is no ads, because there is no direct competition — and that&#x27;s the only way. There is only 1 laundry powder, so you don&#x27;t have to choose. There may be several laundry powders, each one being the best for a specific type of clothing. And there may be even several laundry powders for each type, one simply being cheaper than the other. But there is always one definitive answer, to which one is the best, so you can make your choice just applying the appropriate filters in your groceries app. Similarly, when you choose a smartphone, you don&#x27;t really need reminded about samsung being the best everywhere you go: you just go to gsmarena (or such), use some filters and make an informed choice. If an app&#x2F;consultant&#x2F;oracle&#x2F;search engine can <i>truly</i> allow you to choose what&#x27;s best for you, nobody would think about it as an advertisement, and nobody would need to place it anywhere, because you&#x27;ll consciously ask it when you need an advice.<p>Ads are not about that. They are about shouting your product name loud enough to substitute or even obstruct making an informed choice. This is pretty much necessary, when you have 20 laundry powder brands, that make essentially the same product, neither being the best for anyone. And while it could be unnecessary when selling a phone (since all of them are actually different, even if only in how they look), it isn&#x27;t in the current market, since they need to persuade you that you need a new phone.<p>So, all ads are bad, but they are unavoidable in a free-market economics, where competition exists. And controlling them doesn&#x27;t sound ok to me. To be fair, I&#x27;m somewhat libertarian-minded in general, so of course it doesn&#x27;t sound ok to me, but, seriously, where should one draw the line? Is product-placement in movies ok? Is a guy shouting on a street for people come into a restaurant ok? Sure, there is a lot of gradient in-between all this and spoiling the city landscape or even drawing coca cola banners with lasers on the night&#x27;s sky. But then regulating such things isn&#x27;t really about regulating ads, since this could be about art projects as well. And, furthermore, one could just call coca-cola banner an art project anyway.<p>So, I don&#x27;t see what should I be fighting against, and how should I do that. I appreciate that somebody out there is concerned and stands against evil ad-corporations, but I&#x27;m almost holding back to not call it futile.",
